				<p class="descript">Now more than ever, energy conservation is a top priority for homeowners when choosing windows for their home.
				<br><br>
				For many homeowners, purchasing replacement windows in Queens & Nassau County is a substantial investment. The new windows not only must enhance the appearance of your home inside and out, but also increase energy savings year-round.
				<br><br>Reducing energy loss is often the number one reason for purchasing new windows. Windows are roughly 80% glass so it is important to choose the ideal glass system for your home and climate. Upgrading to a high performance insulated glass system with Low-E glass will help further increase year-round energy savings.</p>
