				<div class="descript">A well-designed roof does a good job of keeping water from entering your home by deflecting rainwater toward the roof edge. From there a quality gutter system finishes the job by conducting the water down and away from the home itself.<br><br>
				Without gutters, water spilling off the roof would wear away siding, windows, lower roofs, foundation, landscaping - anything in the path of cascading water. Water entering your home can stain walls, rot wood framing, even crack a cement foundation.<br><br>
				That's why a properly functioning Queens gutter and downspout system from Blake Windows, Siding &amp; Roofing is essential to prevent water from entering your home and causing flooding and structural damage. Our roofing systems include a gutter system that is properly designed, fabricated and installed to provide the necessary capacity to handle almost any amount of runoff.<br><br>
				Gutters and downspouts must be the right size to accommodate the expected volume of water without filling up and overflowing, all while looking proportional to your home. Blake Windows, Siding &amp; Roofing installs seamless aluminum or copper gutters to provide the highest durability and dependability.<br><br>
